## About Me
My first experience with coding was in 2011 when I had a semi-successful blog on Tumblr. I didn't want to use a default theme, so I choose to customize it myself and add a couple of features. Sice then I've been fascinated with coding. However, only this year I've decided to take up a course at the Rolling Scopes School and fully immerse myself in it.
